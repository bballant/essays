# Software Engineering Aphorisms

Over the years I've collected a number of software engineering aphorisms. I will put them here and update this list as I hear or remember more. It is impossible to attribute these to their specific sources in most cases, but I will try some form of attribution where I can.
All of these will be embarrassingly familiar to my teammates because I so often repeat them:

_All full stack apps eventually become Content Management Systems._

The next two I heard on the embedded.fm podcast, but I had heard very similar things before in other places:

_We don't have time to do it right, but we do have time to do it twice._

_Two weeks of coding can replace two hours of planning._

The next comes from a sardonic sysops guy I worked with, back when teams had sysops:

_Worst case scenario, we're totally f**ked._

One of my many past bosses used to say:

_It's twice as hard to debug code as it is to write it, so be half as clever when you write it._

Then there's Hofstadter's law which is wonderfully recursive:

_It will take longer than planned even when taking into account Hofstadter's law._

And Conway's law which has an air of inevitability:

_A company's software architecture will reflect the company's organizational structure._

Another boss once told me:

_Don't worry about the business so much, just keep adding value._

There's a version of this for everything, although I think the original was about databases, with the theme that fewer tools is good:

_We had one problem, we introduced technology X to solve it, then we had two problems._

The one I probably repeat to project management types the most after reciting Hofstadter's law:

_The last 10% of the project takes 90% of the time._

This breakdown is worse if you're trying to get the first version out:

_Shipping V1 is almost impossible._

And sometimes it takes backtracking on weeks of work. But we celebrate deleting code because we know:

_Software development is a (non-linear) process._

Finally, my very favorite aphorism comes from yet another former boss:

_More typing leads to more bugs._

The implication, which I repeat to my team often, quoting the Paul Rudd character in _Forgetting Sarah Marshall_, is:

_Do less._
